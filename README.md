# cordova-java-8

This plugin attempts to convince Cordova to compile against Java 8 instead of Java 6 on Java platforms.

**Do only install if you need Java 8 and know why you need Java 8, this is NOT an update for the compiler**

### Installation
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/ptuanvu/cordova-java-8.git --link
